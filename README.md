# Neovim Config

My personal Neovim configuration using **lazy.nvim** as the plugin manager. This setup is focused on performance, modularity, and ease of maintenance. I will be adding features progressively.

## 📁 Installation

Clone this repository into your Neovim configuration directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antoinepdev/antoine.dots ~/.config/nvim
```

Then open Neovim. Plugins will be installed automatically by `lazy.nvim`.

## ✅ Features

Currently a minimal setup. More features and modules will be added incrementally.

* ⚡ Powered by [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for fast startup

## 🛠 Requirements

* Linux system
* Neovim >= 0.11.3

## 📌 Notes

* This config is under active development.
* Feel free to fork and customize to your needs.

Made with ❤️ for Neovim.
